- [ ] Configure FROM_EMAIL in .env
- [ ] Configure FRONTEND_URL in .env
- [ ] Test email verification flow
- [ ] Test token validation
- [ ] Test email sending

## Files Modified/Created:
- [x] `backend/package.json` (dependencies added)
- [x] `backend/models/userModel.js` (verification fields & methods added)
- [x] `backend/services/emailService.js` (created with SendGrid integration)
- [x] `backend/templates/emailVerification.hbs` (created)
- [x] `backend/controllers/authController.js` (verification functions added)

## Environment Variables Needed:
- SENDGRID_API_KEY (SendGrid API key)
- FROM_EMAIL (sender email address)

## API Endpoints Created:
- GET `/api/auth/verify-email?token=<token>&email=<email>` - Verify email with token
- POST `/api/auth/resend-verification` - Resend verification email (body: {email})

## Next Steps:
1. Configure environment variables in .env file
2. Test the email verification flow
3. Optionally add email verification check to login process
4. Consider adding frontend components for email verification
