## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Testing Notes

1. **Test Email Domain Issue**: The `@example.com` domain used in testing doesn't accept real emails
2. **SendGrid API Key**: Need to ensure proper SendGrid API key is configured in environment variables
3. **Environment Variables**: Need to add SendGrid configuration to `.env` file

## üß™ Testing Required

1. **With Real Email**: Test registration and verification with a real email address
2. **SendGrid Configuration**: Verify SendGrid API key and sender email are properly configured
3. **Token Expiration**: Test token expiration (24 hours by default)
4. **Resend Functionality**: Test resending verification emails

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Configure SendGrid**: Add proper SendGrid API key and sender email to environment
2. **Test with Real Email**: Register a user with a real email address and verify the flow
3. **Frontend Integration**: Update frontend to handle email verification responses
4. **Error Handling**: Improve error messages and user feedback

## üéØ API Endpoints Ready

- `POST /api/auth/register` - Creates user and sends verification email

- `GET /api/auth/verify-email?token=...&email=...` - Verifies email with token
- `POST /api/auth/resend-verification` - Resends verification email

## üìß Email Flow
